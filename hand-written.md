[Scala 2.13.0-RC1](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.0-RC1) further refines and polishes the new collections API, among other improvements.

If no major problems are found in this release candidate, we will re-release it as 2.13.0.  In the meantime, we'll be working primarily on documentation and on helping the ecosystem upgrade.
